# OPA-4

Starting to move OPA-4 from [Andreas' private OPA page](https://andreas-streun.de/opa) to GitHub.

Code documentation (LaTeX) in progress, some clean-up of code is done during documentation, when finished (by end of June hopefully) we can start :-)

Documentation moved to its [own repository](https://github.com/opa-andreas/opa4-documentation).
