# How to make a release

1. Merge all the code you want in the release into the main branch.

2. Test locally so the main branch compiles and runs correctly.

3. Add a version tag. This you can do either in the terminal or in the web interface.

4. The GitHub workflow for making a release will now run. It will not make the release directly but just a draft.

5. Go to the draft, add the release notes you would want and approve the release.
