\section{How to use this document}
This document is intended to support program developers, who want to maintain the existing OPA code, or to rewrite it in another environment, or to extract useful parts for integration into other codes. It

When reading this document, the source code may be examined in parallel, preferably in the Lazarus IDE. In order to see how the code works, OPA may be executed or the tutorial \cite{tutorial} may be consulted. Further information on using OPA is found in the user guide \cite{userguide} and the underlying physics is outlined in \cite{inside}.

In this document following styles are used:\\
Pieces of code are shown in \code{typewriter style}.
\opagui{GUI} is a graphical user interface, usually based on class \code{TForm}. \opaguif{Frame} if a user-defined GUI-component, usually based on class \code{TFrame}.  \opauni{Unit} is a standard Pascal unit. 

A GUI or a frame has a list of \guico{actions} corresponding to the event handlers of its components, for example a button to be pressed. The pure Pascal units are passive, they contain a set of public \unico{procedures} which are called from the GUIs. Frames too may contain public \guifco{procedures}. Thus in this documentation, action lists are given for the GUIs and frames, and lists of public procedures for the frames and units. All modules may offer public variables, here coloured \guico{x}, \guifco{y}, \unico{z} for GUIs, frames, units.

GUI components accept user input and/or launch events. Some have captions, like \ofld{Buttons}, others not, like for example a \ofldx{plot area} responding to mouse clicks. The general scheme is \evcod{component}{event handler}. Event handlers may call private procedures of the GUI or public procedures from units as listed in the \guico{uses} section. For the units \prcod{unit}{procedure} refers to a procedure in a unit.

In this document, \todo{red italics give informations about bugs and other problems and/or suggestions for future improvements.} \feature{Green italics mention particular features which distinguish OPA from other beam dynamics and should be preserved.}

Questions may be adressed to the author at \url{mailto:psi@andreas-streun.de}.

%\opamust indicates that this part of the code is essential and should be included
\newpage


\section{OPA status}

Following semantic versioning \cite{semver} version 4.063 of OPA was renamed 4.1.0. However, since up to now only the author worked on the code, the distinctions MAJOR, MINOR, PATCH rather refer to the changes as visible to the users than to the API. 


Current version is OPA 4.1.1. It includes 44 Pascal units \code{.pas}, 28 of them are \opagui{GUIs} which are accompanied by a Lazarus form \code{.lfm} (created by the Lazarus IDE), and 16 of them are Pascal \opauni{units}. Five of the GUIs are \opaguif{frames}, i.e. self-defined components embedded in other GUIs. Four units are located in a parallel folder, here called \code{../com/} since they are not OPA specific but used with other programs too.
Table~\ref{tabover} lists the units. The column "Size" lists the lines of code as a rough estimate for the complexity of the unit. Furthermore, OPA includes a couple of image files \code{.ico, .bmp} to draw symbols on buttons. 

A GUI defines a class, given in table~\ref{tabover} in the column "class". The actual GUI is the one and only instance of this class, i.e. a public variable, usually with the name as the class but without the leading "T". A frame also defines a class but no instance, instead the parent GUI will define one or more instances of this class as variables.

In general GUIs should handle the user interactions only while the Pascal units do all the calculations. This separation was largely realized in OPA, however not strictly. Some minor calculations are done in the GUI in some places.

OPA was developed over more than 30 years along the design of SLS, SLS 2.0 and other machines, and features were implemented as needed for design work. The program code reflects this history and may not present the most logical structure. Also the names of the units (including inconsistent use of capitals) are historical and could be changed to more meaningful descriptors.\\

In this document section \ref{secglob} will explain the "backbone" of OPA, which are the global datatypes and variables, the main menu and units for mathematics and graphics which are used by many GUIs. 
Section \ref{secedit} contains lattice file handling and the two editors, text-based and "LEGO" block like.

Beam physics starts with section \ref{seclino} on the interactive linear optics design panel and related GUIs and units and continues with section~\ref{secmomo} on off-momentum optics. The non-linear optimization module is explained in section~\ref{secnonl}, and section~\ref{secorin} covers injection and orbit correction.

Editors for the RF bucket and longitudinal gradient bends are explained in section~\ref{secspee}, the three tracking modules with their library in section \ref{sectrac}, and everything else like machine layout and magnet currents in section~\ref{secelse}.

\section{\label{secglob}Main programs and general use}

\ounih{Main program}{{opa.lpr}}

\desc{The main program file which allocates the units as described below and creates some of the forms. It is created more or less automatically by the Lazarus IDE.}


\ounih{Global data}{OPAglobal}

\desc{
This unit defines global constants, types and variables and thus is OPA's "database". It is also initialized first when OPA starts and sets environment variables and default values. Public variables defined here are used by the other modules, since almost all of them use \ouni{OPAglobal}. These "global" variables contain the basic lattice data, status flags, handles to access GUI components and temporary data to be exchanged between modules. This unit also provides many public procedures for various non-physics tasks. Only an overview can be given here, and the most important or complex things will be explained. Everything else should become clear from the code, hopefully.

\todo{The \ouni{OPAglobal} unit grew large large and heterogenous over the years and should be split into several units for the different functions to be performed, or procedures should be moved to other units if applicable.}

Like other beam dynamics programs OPA works on a lattice file. It contains {\em elements}, mainly magnets of different type, and {\em segments}, which are line-ups of elements and segments. One of the segments is selected and expanded to become {\em the lattice} to work with. Element parameters, e.g. quadrupole strength in the lattice file can be numbers or arithmetic expressions using {\em variables}, which are part of the lattice file too.
}

\uses{\opauni{../com/mathlib}, \opauni{../com/asaux}}

\pvar{
Constants include general settings, array sizes, color definitions, name strings and values of flags later to be referenced by name.\\

Following type definitions may be considered as non-trivial:

\unico{ElementType} is a case-record for defining element parameters such as length, quad focusing strength, dipole bending angle etc. Several (but not all) parameters may be arithmetic expressions instead of numbers. For more details see the user guide \cite{userguide} or the source code. 

\unico{variable\_type} is for variables defined by name and value or arithmetic expressions. Variables are referenced in arithmetic expressions of element parameters or in other variables.

\unico{AbstractEleType} represents either an element or a segment and contains pointers to previous and next abstract elements. The abstract element may be inverted or repeated.

\unico{SegmentType} is for segments, which are series of abstract elements, defined by pointers to its initial and final abstract element.

\unico{LatticeType} is a lattice entry. The lattice is built by expanding a segment, so it contains only elements, and additional information on direction (if the element is inverted), and data relevant for orbit correction (misaligmnets and if the element sits on a girder). \\
\feature{Unlike several other codes OPA handles correctly nested inversions of segments to obtain the correct orientation of the element in the lattice. This is relevant for bending magnets with unequal edge properties.}

\unico{OmarkType} is a set of optics data as property of the element type "optics marker".

\unico{OpValType} is an extended set of optics data used for propagation in \ouni{OPAElements}.

\unico{GirderType} describes a girder by first and last lattice entry of elements sitting on the girder, and by the type of connection to adjacent girders.

\unico{CurveType} is a point in an optical functions curve including a pointer to the next point.

\unico{CurvePlotType} defines a curve by a pointer to its initial point.

\unico{DefaultType} defines a user setting by name and value. Default values are defined by \\ \prcod{OPAglobal}{Initialization} but can be modified by the user and saved.

Other types are mainly shortcut definitions to gather interrelated data.\\

Here are the most important global variables. If not mentioned otherwise, the type name is the variable name with suffix \code{type}. Usually only one instance exists:

\unico{Elem} and \unico{Ella} are arrays of \unico{Elementtype}, where the first one is read from file and manipulated in the editors, while the second one are a subset of elements used in the lattice and to be modified in the various calculations. After terminating a calculation the user is asked to save or cancel the changes, which causes the \unico{Ella}-data to be copied back to the \unico{Elem} array or not.

\unico{Segm}, \unico{Lattice} and \unico{Girder} are arrays of corresponding types. Maximum array length is defined in the \code{const} section of the unit.

\unico{Glob} saves some global parameters like beam energy, default aperture size etc.

\unico{Status} is a group of status flags to be set by the outcome of calculations in order to enable or disable buttons and to re-use data in other calculations.

\unico{MainButtonHandles} provides global control of the various options in \ogui{opamenu} to enable or disable them based on the status flags.

\unico{GlobDef} and \unico{Def} of \unico{DefaultType} are arrays of user-defined settings, which are read at start and when switching the working folder. 

\unico{Beam} saves beam parameters like tune, emittance etc.

\unico{SnapSave} stores intermediate results in order to re-use them in other modules, for example analytical results from the nonlinear optimization to compare them later with tracking. (Furthermore, some data are saved which are relevant for machine control and to be exported by \ogui{OPACurrents} to an EPICS \code{.snap} file.) \todo{Data are not invalidated yet, if something was modified in the lattice.}

\todo{There are more variables of basic types, which better should not be globally visible to avoid errors and confusion. Wherever possible they may become local, or they should be hidden behind set- and get-procedures.}

}

\ppro{
This listing of procedures is more or less inverse to the (historical and illogical) arrangement in the source file:

\unico{Initialization} sets some global variables to reasonable initial values, sets all status flags to false, and sets default values for $\sim$250 user settings.
Then it sets the OPA directory and tries to read the files \code{opa4\_path.ini} which contains a list of last used files. Then it reads \code{opa4\_glob\_ini} containing global user settings (at the moment this is only the amount of output). Finally, it takes the folder from the first entry in the list of last used files to set the working folder and reads the file \code{opa4\_set.ini} in this folder to restore the $\sim$250 user settings. If these files are missing, the default values are used.

\unico{GlobDefWriteFile} and \unico{DefWriteFile} write the user settings back to these files if the session is regularly terminated by \evcod{opamenu}{ExitOPA}.

\unico{MakeLattice} builds the lattice from elements and segments. Since a segment istelf contains elements and segments, the internal procedure \unico{SegLat} is called recursively to unpack the data. 
%If a list of real names (from machine control system) is available, these names are 
The elements, which are used in the lattice are copied from the \unico{Elem} to the \unico{Ella} array, and correctors and monitors with generic names \code{CH,CV,MON}
are expanded into separate instances named \code{CH001,CH002...} to adress them individually in orbit correction in unit \ogui{OPAorbit}. Finally status flags are set.

\unico{GirderSetup} evaluates the girder structure if contained in the lattice and allocates the lattice elements to the corresponding girders.

\unico{IniElem} sets default values for new elements.

\unico{AppendAE, ClearSeg, NAESeg} are procedures to handle segments, which are series of pointers to elements or other segments.

\unico{AppendCurve, ClearCurve}  prepare data sets for plotting curves of optical functions. 

\unico{AppendChar} builds a linked list of characters for \ogui{texteditor} \todo{(wrong place)}.

\unico{putkval, getkval, putSexkval, getSexkval} functions are shortcuts to set or get the parameter which is considered the strength of a magnet.

\unico{FillComboSeg} fills the list of last used files in \ogui{opamenu}.

\unico{OPALog} writes a message to the log window in \ogui{opamenu}.

\unico{MainButtonEnable} enables or disables the options in \ogui{opamenu} depending on the status flags. For example, tracking is only enabled if a periodic solution exists.

\unico{PassMainButtonHandles} and \unico{passErrLogHandle} take handles to the GUI components of \ogui{opamenu} to enable other units using \ouni{OPAglobal} to enable/disable them.

\unico{EllaSave} and \unico{Elcompare} check if elements in lattice (\unico{Ella}) have been changed with regard to the original elements (\unico{Elem}) and ask the user if the changes should be saved.

The procedures and functions listed under "Calculator" are an arithmetic evaluator adapted from \cite{rosetta}. Other procedures not listed here include variable, element and segment to string conversion and other utilities which may be self-explanbatory.

\ounih{Mathematics library}{mathlib}

\desc{
A library of mathemical functions: definition of types and operations with vectors, matrices and complex numbers. It further contains some special functions, among them the Touschek integral function, and implementations of Powell's minimizer, LU decomposition and Singular Value Decomposition taken from \cite{numrec}, but extended to dynamic array size. OPA does not link external libraries but all algorithms needed are included in the code.}

\uses{none}

\pvar{
Types define vectors and matrices for beam dynamics, geometry and for the Powell minimization procedure. The only public variables are the parameters for Powell. 
}

\ppro{
Most procedures are elementary operations on vectors, matrices and complex numbers, or for special functions, and don't need to be explained.

\unico{CTouschek} and \unico{CTouschek\_pol} solve the Touschek lifetime integral, see appendix C.1 in \cite{inside} for details. The first procedure solves the integral based on Simpson's rule, the second procedure uses a polynomial approximation for speed-up. 

\unico{EulerAng} calculates rotation angles from a rotation matrix as explained in \cite{euler}.

\unico{LUDCMP} and \unico{LUBKSB} peform LU-decomposition and backsubstitution to solve linear systems of equations as described in \cite{numrec}. This is used in particuar for matrix inversion, \unico{MatInv} and \unico{MatDet}. The procedures are set fix to 5 dimensions.


\unico{svdcmp} and \unico{svbksb} perform singular value decomposition and backsubstitution to solver lineaer systems of equations as described in \cite{numrec}. SVD is superiour to LUD for non-square and degenerate systems. An packing/unpacking algorithms was added to use the procedures with arbitrary dimension. The procedure is used in orbit correction in \ogui{OPAorbit} and for setting octupole families in \ogui{OPAChroma}.

\unico{Powell} is an implementation of Powell's minimizer for steepest gradient search in $N$ dimensions taken from \cite{numrec}. It is used for sextupole optimization in \ogui{OPAChroma}, for longitudinal gradient optimization in \ogui{LGBeditor}, and (test mode only) for non-linear optimization in \ogui{OPAmomentum}.

A file header is written, defining the BoundingBox as the canvas screen size. Then macros for text alignment are defined in postscript language. If opening the file fails, an error message is returned.

\guifco{PS\_stop} closes the \code{*.eps} file and sets the flag \guifco{PS} to \code{false}.

\guifco{SetRange*}, \guifco{SetMargin*} etc set plot ranges and scaling as displayed in Fig.\ref{vprange}. The vertical screen coordinate counts downwards whereas the physical coordinates as well as the Postscript coordinates count upwards. 

\guifco{getpx,getpy} and \guifco{PS\_getpxr,PS\_getpyr} translate physical coordinates $x,y$ into screen, resp. Postscript coordinates (upper/lower line):
\[
{\tt px}={\tt px0}+\frac{\tt pxrange}{x_{\rm range}} (x-x_{\rm min}) \qquad
{\tt py}=\left\{ \begin{array}{r} {\tt py0} + \\ {\tt pytotal} - {\tt py0} -  \end{array} \right\} \frac{(-{\tt pyrange})}{y_{\rm range}} (y-y_{\rm min}) \qquad
\]

\guifco{AdjustAspectRatio} adjusts the plot ranges such, that the unit is the same horizontal and vertical, i.e. a circle appears as circle not as an ellipse.

\guifco{Axis} plots an axis with even numbers as annotations and ranges, also extracting an exponent if needed. 

\guifco{GetAxisSpace} returns the space required for the axis annotations without drawing the axis in order to adjust the plot range accordingely. It is called first by the calling GUI, in particular by \oguif{../com/asfigure}.

\guifco{Circle} and \guifco{Ellipse} plot a circle or a (sheared) ellipse in beam dynamics notation.

\guifco{GrabImage} copies the screen canvas to the system clipboard, useful to catch plots for draft notes.

All the other procedures are mainly wrappers for the standard plot commands or shortcuts to draw arrows, symbols etc.

\guifco{Stroke} does nothing on the screen but terminates a series of plot commands in Postscript. Curve plotting procedures need to terminate a \guifco{LineTo...} loop by calling \guifco{stroke}.

\guifco{assignScreen} creates \guifco{Vplot} and passes the paintbox canvas in order to plot on the screen.

\guifco{forceMargin*} set fixed margins for the plot and supresses auto-scaling by subsequent calls to \guifco{Init} or \gfcod{Vgraph}{Axis}.

\guifco{Init} starts the plot.

\act{
\evcodxf{plot area}{pMouseDown,pMouseMove,pMouseUp} handles mouse events inside the plot area.

\section{\label{secedit}Lattice I/O and Edit} 

\ounih{Lattice files}{opalatticefiles}

\desc{Lattice data are read from and saved to files called \code{*.opa}. Reading a file copies its content into a linked list of characters (basically a long string) in \grcod{opamenu}{ReadFile}.

There is an option to read additional files of magnet calibrations and allocations (i.e. real magnet types and names associated with the element), in order to prepare data for the machine control system.

Files from other beam dynamics programs can be read and written, however, this includes only the basic parameters and may require some manual editing to make these files work. This includes Tracy-2 or -3 files \code{*.lat}, Elegant files \code{*.ele,*.lte}, MAD files \code{*.mad} and MAD sequence files \code{*.seq}.
}

\uses{\ouni{OPAglobal}, \ouni{mathlib}, \ouni{../com/asaux}}

\ppro{
\unico{Latread} evaluates the character list of type \unico{TextBuffer}: comments, enclosed by \{ \} brackets, are skipped. An input line is terminated by a semicolon (;), its length is unlimited and it may break over several lines in the lattice file.  Input lines are evaluated by searching first for a colon (:) which identfies an element or segment, or, if not found, a variable.

A variable input line contains a name, an equal sign ($=$) and a value or an expression.
Reserved variables are found searching for the names TITLE, ALLOCATION, CALIBRATION (containing a title of the lattice and the names of optional allocation and calibration files), and by searching in the list of keywords \unico{globkeyw} containing ENERGY and other global parameters. Other names not matching these keywords are considered as user-defined variables.

An element or segment input line contains a name, the colon (:) and a comma-separated list of tokens.

An element is recognized if the colon is followed by a valid element type name in list \unico{elemkeyw} (which is based on \unico{ElemName} in \ouni{OPAglobal}). Then the tokens are expected to contain each a parameter identifier, an equal sign ($=$) and a value or expression. There are many parameters for the different element types. The element is created and the values are assigned.

For a segment the tokens are names of elements or segments, both are  assigned to a linked list of type \unico{AbstractEleType} as defined in \ouni{OPAglobal}.

If names of allocation or calibration files were given, these files are read now.

Finally, the lattice is built from the last segment calling \prcod{OPAglobal}{MakeLattice}.\\


\unico{LatReadCom} is called after LatRead and searches the lattice string for a pair of tokens \code{\{com} and \code{com\}} to save the text between. All other comments contained in the lattice and enclosed in \{ \} brackets only are not saved.\\

\unico{ReadAllocation} and \unico{ReadCalibration} read additional optional files containing lists of magnet types and real names and the magnet calibrations in order to calculate the magnet currents in \guico{OPACurrents}. 
An example for SLS is found at \url{https://ados.web.psi.ch/slsdesc/optic/magnets.html}. 

The \unico{ElementType} in \ouni{OPAglobal} contains a pointer to a linked list of \unico{NameListType},  which contains real names of elements, name of power supply, i.e. control channel, polarity etc. \\


\unico{lteconvert}, \unico{madconvert} and \unico{madseqconvert} try to make Elegant \code{*.lte} and MAD \code{*.mad} and \code{*.seq} files understandable for OPA. They work on the \unico{TextBuffer} string by exchanging keywords and inserting conversion factors without analyzing the lattice itself. This is then done by a subsequent call to \unico{LatRead}. Tracy \code{*.lat} and Elegant \code{*.ele} files can be digested directly by \unico{LatRead}.\\

\unico{WriteLattice} accepts a variable \unico{mode} of value \code{0..5} to write an OPA, Tracy-2, Elegant, MAD-X, BMAD or Tracy-3 file. \unico{mode} \code{6} writes an OPA-file with all arithmetic expressions expanded into numbers.

Different beam dynamics codes use different units (e.g. degrees or radians) and different definitions of magnet order and strength. Only OPA, Elegant and Tracy-3 handle correctly nested inversions of segments to implement an asymmetric element (e.g. dipole with different entry and exit edge angles) correctly in the lattice. Export to the other programs requires to create and insert inverted segments (prefix \code{I\_}) for all segments containing asymmetric elements.

All  programs mentioned above allow arithmetic expressions instead of plain values for element parameters. However, unlike the others, Elegant uses inverse Polish notation, which is not included here, therefore expressions are expanded, i.e. resolved to values, for Elegant.

Further export of data is straightforward: first variables, then elements, then segments. The complete lattice file is returned as one long string.

\todo{Type \unico{TextBuffer} is a linked list of characters and has historical origin. It could be replaced by a long string, which would be much simpler.}

\act{
\evcodx{text window}{disableOKBut} disables the \ofld{OK} button when text is changed. No other action is done on text input.

\evcod{Test}{filetest} performs a test of the input by calling \prcod{opalatticefiles}{LatRead}. Before, the input is copied into a buffer, then, by calling \prcod{OPAglobal}{PassErrLogHandle}, the output from \unico{LatRead} is redirected from the \ogui{opamenu} main log window to the local error log window \guico{myerrlog}, because the main GUI may be covered by the text editor GUI. If the test is successful, the \ofld{OK} button is enabled. Then the handle for output is set back to the main GUI.


\evcod{OK}{fileget} reads the lattice in the same way, now knowing that the input is a valid lattice, and exits. At Exit, the segment drop down list in the mnain GUI is set to the last segment, from which the lattice was built by \prcod{opalatticefiles}{LatRead}.

\evcod{Cancel}{fileRestore} ignores the text window, reads the lattice from the buffer as saved at \guico{Init} and exits.

}

\todo{Nowadays better text editors may be available, which include colored mark-up, auto-complete options and real time checks.}

\oguih{Interactive Editor}{OPAEditor}

The "OPA Editor" allows to create elements and compose a lattice without knowing element type names and lattice file syntax. It is more suitable for beginners, while the text editor may be more convenient for experienced users.

The GUI displays two lists, one for variables and elements, the other one for segments. In addition some global parameters like beam energy and default magnet aperture may be set.

If another line of the list is clicked then object \guico{EditElemSet} of class \ogui{EdElSet} is intitalized by calling two different procedures depending on if the clicked item represents a variable or an element, and a handle to this list is passed.

\evcodx{Segment List}{ListBoxSClick} initializes object \guico{EditSegSet} of class \ogui{EdSgSet} by passing a handle to this list.

\evcod{Beam energy}{EditGloEKeyPress}, \evcodx{aperture fields}{EditA*KeyPress},\\ \evcod{Magnet pole radius}{EdrrefKeyPress} are edit fields to accept values for beam energy, for element default apertures, and for default magnet pole inscribed radius.

\ofldx{Comment window} (no event) text window \guico{MemCom} accepts a comment, which will be saved in the lattice file between the \code{\{com...com\}} tokens.

\evcod{Invert all dipole polarities}{ButDipInv} inverts all dipole polarities.

\evcod{Expand undulators}{ButExpUndClick} expands an undulator into a series of dipoles and drift spaces creating the elements and re-defining the undulator as segment. Usually undulator is a basic element, and the series of dipoles and drifts is executed internally and not visible to the user.

\evcod{Set all apertures}{ButAllAperClick} sets all apertures to the values given in the \guico{EditAx}, \guico{EditAy} fields thus overwriting individual element settings. 

\ofld{Set all (not only if larger)} (no event) if checkbox \guico{ChkAll} is checked, apertures of all elements are set, otherwise only those which have a larger aperture than the values in the fields.

\ofld{Invert rotations in inverted segments} (no event): If  checkbox \guico{ChkGloRi} is ticked or not defines if a beam rotation is inverted (like an asymmetric elements) or not when a segment containing the rotations is  inverted. A corresponding flag \unico{glob.rot\_inv} is set and saved in the lattice file.

\evcod{Exit}{ButExit} saves data, updates the segment drop down list in \ogui{opamenu} and closes the GUI.

\oguih{Element Creator}{EdElCreate} 

\desc{This small GUI pops up, when \code{new entry} is clicked in the \ouni{OPAEditor} elements and variables list. A new element or variable is created after selecting its type and giving it a name. Then the GUI is closed and the \ogui{EdElSet} GUI pops up.}

}

\act{
\evcodx{Kind}{ComETypeChange} selects the type of element from the list.

\evcodx{Name}{EdENameChange} accepts the name of the element.

\evcod{Create}{ButCreClick} tests the input, if a type was defined, if the new entry is a variable or an element, and adds it to the corresponding arrays.

\todo{Bug: there is no check for duplicate entries, should be added.}


\oguih{Element Editor}{EdElSet} 

\desc{
Main component of the GUI is a table to edit all parameters of an element or a variable. Some fields may contain algebraic expressions to calculate parameters from variables. This procedure is called in four different ways, for elements and for variables, and from editor or from optics design. For (iron dominated) magnets, a possible pole-profile is plotted.
}

\uses{\ouni{OPAglobal}, \ouni{opticplot}, \oguif{../com/asfigure}, \ouni{../com/asaux}}

\ppro{
\guico{InitE}, \guico{InitEVar}, \guico{InitO},  \guico{InitOVar} are four different initialization procedures, for elements and variables, and for calling from the interactive editor \ogui{OPAEditor} or from the linear optics design \ogui{opticview}. In edit mode, a handle to the element list in \ogui{opamenu} is passed, the element index is taken from the list, and the element to be edited is taken from the original element array \unico{Elem}. In optics mode, the index is given explicity and adresses the \unico{Ella} subset of elements in the lattice, and a handle to the plot window of \ogui{opticview} is passed to enable an update of the plot when the element is changed. For variables there is only one array \unico{Variable} (The arrays are defined in \ouni{OPAglobal}). \\
Then two private procedures are called, which are common for edit and optics mode, to fill the table with data of the element or variable. For elements several lines are filled depending on the type of element, for variables it is only one line. Some element properties and variables may have a value {\em and} an arithmetic expression (like "A+B"), which is a string for variables and a pointer for elements. If the string is empty or the pointer is \code{nil}, the value is taken in edit mode. In optics mode, the calculated value from the expression is shown too ("2.5 = A+B") for elements. For variables the expression is shown in both modes.\\
If the element is a quadrupole or a bending magnet, the GUI is extended by a plot area of type \oguif{asfigure} to show its pole profile.

\guico{getJelem} just returns the index of the selected element in order to enable \ogui{opticview} to kill this GUI if the user assigns the element to a knob.
}
\act{

\evcod{Done}{butOKClick} and \evcod{Apply}{butApplyClick} both read the table and update the element. The \ofld{Apply} button is only enabled in optics mode and does not close the GUI in order to view how the change affects the optics.\\ 
The private procedure \guico{SetElem} for updating the element performs several steps:
In edit mode, it reads the name of the element, checks if it already exists, and, if not, if this element is used in segments, and asks, if all these entries should be renamed too. Then, in both modes, the table is read and the values are assigned to the element depending on its type. This includes conversion from convenient input units to internal SI-units. The validity of data is checked, i.e. if values are valid numbers, and if expressions can be executed without error. If everything is ok, then, in edit mode, data are written to the selected element in the \unico{Elem} array and updated in the elements list of the calling \ogui{opamenu} GUI. In optics mode, the element in the \unico{Ella} array is updated, the optics is recalculated calling \prcod{opticsplot}{OpticReCalc}, and the plot in the calling \ogui{opticview} GUI is updated by sending it a \code{repaint} event.\\
For variables, the private procedure \guico{SetVar} performs similar actions: In edit mode it reads the name, checks if it already exists, and, if not, it this variable is used in any expression, and asks if all these entries should be renamed too. Then in both modes, its expression is read from the table. (If the expression can be converted into a valid number, this value is assigned and the expression set to an empty string to identify a primary variable, which is a pure number.) Then, depending on the mode, the \ogui{opamenu} list is updated or the \ogui{opticview} plot is updated.

\evcod{Cancel}{butCancelClick} does nothing but closing the GUI.

\evcodx{Parameter table}{TabDrawCell} checks if input is a valid number and marks it red in case of error. This is not done in edit mode, since input may be an expression. In optics mode, expressions as input are not editable.

\guico{ppaint} reacts on repaint events for the form and plots the magnet profile, it is activated at initialization.

\oguih{Segment Editor}{EdSgSet}

\uses{\ouni{OPAglobal}, \ouni{../com/asaux}}

\ppro{
\guico{Init} passes a handle to the segment list in \ogui{OPAEditor} and loads the abstract element sequence of the segment, which was clicked in the list, into the string grid. If entries contain an inversion flag or a multiplication factors, this is written to the grid cell too. The segment name is written to the \ofldx{Modify segment} name field at top, and its periodicity (replication factor) to the \ofldx{periodicity} field at bottom. If the first line of the segment list was clicked, a new segment is to be created and grid and name edit field stay empty.
}
\act{
\evcodx{Grid}{drawCell} analyzes the content of the cell and assigns a color code for element type, segment or unknown using private procedure \guico{ElemCol\_C}.

\evcodx{Grid}{gridKeyDown} reacts to pressing the CTRL+INSERT or CTRL+DELETE keys on the keyboard by inserting or deleting a grid cell, and shifting up or down the higher cells using private procedure \guico{ShiftCells}.

\evcodx{Modify segment}{EditSegNameChange}: If the name of the segment was changed, the button to create a new segment is enabled.

\evcod{update}{butokClick} and \evcod{create}{butcreClick} call private procedure \guico{SaveSeg} to read the grid cells and edit fields, and to perform several checks before creating or updating the segment:\\
If the grid is empty and the segment is not used by any other segment, then the segment is deleted, otherwise an error message is sent.\\
If the name is invalid or if the name already exists, or if the  segment contains unknown names, error messages are sent.\\
If tests were successful, in case of \ofldx{create} a new segment is appended to the list, in case of \ofldx{update} the existing segment is deleted first by disposing all its abstract element pointers in \prcod{OPAglobal}{ClearSeg}.\\
If an existing segment was renamed, the entry is updated in all others segments. Then, 
the new segment sequence is saved as linked list of abstract elements by \prcod{OPAglobal}{AppendAE}. If the segment was deleted, it is removed from the global \unico{Segm} array and from the \ogui{OPAeditor} segment list, else the list is updated. Finally the exit procedure destroys the GUI.

\evcod{delete}{butdelClick} sets all grid cells to empty strings and performs the delete procedures for an empty segment as described above, and exits.

\evcod{cancel}{butcanClick} does nothing but exit.

\section{\label{seclino}Linear Optics}

\oguih{Linear optics design}{opticview} 

\desc{This is the main GUI for linear optics development. It contains a plot window to show optical functions along the lattice, a table to display beam parameter results, a couple of knobs to be assigned to elements and several buttons for various options and for changing the display. Unlike all other GUIs, the plot window here is not based on \oguif{../com/asfigure}, because it is too complex. All the beam dynamics calculations are done by \ouni{opticplot}.}

\uses{\oguif{knobframe}, \ogui{Opticstart}, \ogui{OpticTune}, \ogui{OpticWOMK},\ogui{OpticEnvel}, \ogui{OpticMatch}, \ouni{opticplot}, \ogui{OPAtune}, \ogui{EdElSet}, \ouni{OPAglobal}, \ouni{mathlib}, \oguif{../com/Vgraph}, \ouni{../com/asaux}} 

\ppro{
\guico{Init} is called from \ogui{opamenu} passing a handle to a tune diagram as defined in \ogui{OPAtune}, which is further passed to \ouni{opticplot}. A \guifco{Vplot} object as defined in \oguif{../com/Vgraph} is created, the corresponding variable for the plot window named \unico{vp}, however, is defined in \ouni{opticplot}, where the calculations take place. A handle to the parameter table \guico{tab} is also passed to \ouni{opticplot}. Then some inital values are set for various data.\\
If the lattice contains variables, copies of their values are saved, and all elements containing expressions are evaluated to check if the variables are used or not in the lattice. For each variable in use, a label is created underneath the plot window. If it is a primary variable (i.e. a number), which can be edited, the label is yellow, if it is a dependant variable (i.e. an expression) the label is pale yellow.\\
Finally the GUI is resized based on saved user settings.
}

\act{
\evcodx{GUI resize}{FormResize} reacts to a resize of the GUI by the user or by the \guico{Init} procedure. The GUI is resized by reserving space for buttons etc. and adjusting plot area, parameter table and labels for the variables to left over space.
Then as many knobs as fit into the GUI are created. these knobs of class 
\guifco{TKnob} are defined in   Since a knob may affect the values of other knobs (in case it will be assigned to a variable), each knob receives handles to all other knob calling public procedure \guifco{BrotherHandles} of \oguif{knobframe}. If the GUI was shrinked, knobs which don't fit in anymore are freed (i.e. destroyed). Finally, the sizes of all components of the GUI are calculated and set.

\evcodx{plot area}{pwpaint} is not activated by the user but by the system if the \code{paintbox} of the plot area receives a generic \code{repaint} event. This is also done by \ogui{opamenu} after calling \guico{Init}. The event calls the private procedure \guico{MakePlot}, which performs these actions:\\
The plot is initialized, i.e. plotting axes etc. The abscissa is always the longitudinal coordinate along the lattice. Regions representing magnets in the lattice are calculated, plotted and saved to later enable reaction on mouse operations.\\
If \guico{MakePlot} is called for the first time, the start GUI \ogui{Opticstart} is launched in front of this GUI and will start the first calculation calling \prcod{opticplot}{OpticCalc}. Finally the resulting optical functions are plotted.\\ \todo{This way to launch the start menu is a bit awkward, there may be a better solution.}

\evcodx{plot area}{pwMouseMove} shows the name of an element when hovering over.

\evcodx{plot area}{pwMouseDown, pwMouseUp} drag an element to a knob, if the left mouse button was pressed inside an element region and released inside a knob region. If an element editor \ogui{EdElSet} is open for this element, it is killed. If the element is already connected to another knob, an error message is displayed.\\
If the element is double-clicked, the element editor \ogui{EdElSet} is opened in optics mode, and if there was a connection to a knob, it is released.\\
If the right mouse button is pressed, the optical function values at this location are shown in the lower part of the table \guico{tab}.

\evcodx{variable labels}{varbutMouseDown, varbutMouseUp} perform the corresponding actions to a variable, if the mouse is pressed inside the region of a yellow variable label and released inside a knob region.



\evcod{Start}{butStarClick} launches the start GUI again, to change initial parameters of the calculation.

Depending on flags set, Kickers, non-linearities, misalignments etc. are switched on or off,  and radiation integrals, path length etc. are calculated.

For display OPA subdivides elements in slices, where the slice length corresponds to one pixel on the screen. This is handled by the procedures \code{>slice...} defining matrices for the slices and for the skipped parts (i.e. out of view range) of the element.

Internal private procedures calculate phase advances and transform between physical, normal modes and normalized normal mode coordinates.\\

\subsection{Editors}



\opamodule{LGBeditor.pas/.lfm}{(19.1k)}{OPAglobal,  MathLib, ASfigure, ASaux}
\opamodule{LGBeditorLib.pas}{(13.9k)}{OPAglobal, ASfigure, ASaux}
These two procedures optimize the field profile of a longitudinal gradient bend in order to minimize quantum excitation, i.e. the $I_5$ radiation integral. Magnet type, length, peak field and number of slices are set before starting a Powell minimizer. The first procedure is mainly the GUI and the minimizer, the second one contains physics and plotting.

\subsection{Optics Design}


\opamodule{OpticPlot.pas}{(98.3k)}{OPAglobal, OPAElements, OPAtune, MathLib, ASfigure, VGraph, ASaux.}
Linear beam optics includes closed orbit finder \code{>CloseOrbit}, periodic solution for coupled and uncoupled lattices \code{>NormalMode, FlatPeriodic}, propagation through elements \code{>Lattel} and full linear optics including integrals \code{>LinOp} with several options for periodic, symmetric, single pass forward, backward, from marker calculations \code{>OpticCalc}. Plot routines show beta functions and dispersions \code{>PlotBeta}, or orbit, envelopes and apertures \code{>PlotOrbit, PlotEnv, PlotApertures}, or magnetic fields \code{>PlotMag}. Lattice parameters are shown in a table \code{>FillBeamTab, FillBetaTab} and several output files can be printed \code{>Print...}\\

\opamodule{Opticstart.pas/.lfm}{(17.3k)}{OPAglobal,  OpticPlot, MathLib, ASaux.}
GUI to select the starting conditions for the optics solution, either periodic/symmetric, or from initial values for orbit, beta functions, dispersion and coupling given at the start or end of lattice or at an intermediate optics marker.\\

\opamodule{OpticEnvel.pas/.lfm}{(9.9k)}{OPAglobal,  OpticPlot, ASaux.}
Select the plot mode to show beta functions (normal mode and/or projected) and dispersions, envelopes with orbit and apertures or magnetic fields. Several parameters may be set, e.g. the reference radius to calculate magnetic fields etc.\\

\opamodule{OpticTune.pas/.lfm}{(6.1k)}{OPAglobal,  OpticPlot, MathLib, ASaux.}
Calculates a $2\times 2$ matrix how the tunes depend on a scaling factor applied to all focusing and defocusing quads and allows the working point to shifted this way.\\

\opamodule{OpticWOMK.pas/.lfm}{(2.5k)}{OPAglobal,  OpticPlot.}
Asks whether an optics solution should be stored in the optics markers.\\

\opamodule{OpticMatch.pas/.lfm}{(42.0k)}{OPAglobal, OpticPlot, OpticMatchScan, Knobframe, ASfigure, ASaux.}
Matching of linear optics using a Newton-Raphson minimizer: Optics parameters to be adjusted with target values and at least the same number of knobs (e.g. quadrupole strenght, variables etc.) are selected, then the minimizer proceeds using the square matrix of most sensitive knobs, which is recalculated after each steps to take into account non-linearities. Reduced step size can be set for better convergence. It is possible to run a scan over some range of a target value.\\
\todo{The matching procedure is quit old and restricted to uncoupled lattices. A more elaborate minimizer also including limits for the knobs should be implemented.}\\

\opamodule{OpticMatchScan.pas/.lfm}{(2.9k)}{OPAglobal,  OpticPlot, ASaux.}
This is just a GUI to enter the range for a target function to run a scan.\\

\opamodule{knobframe.pas}{(11.5k) [Frame] }{OPAglobal, OpticPlot, Mathlib, ASaux.}
The frame provides a knob to control a parameter (quad strength, variable value etc.) including limits and a reset function. A numner of knob frames is embedded in the GUI \code{OpticView, OPAOrbit} as space permits. Knob actions trigger calculations and plots. Knobs may be passive, if the quantity is controlled by a variable connected to another knob. Therefore a knob has to know his fellow knobs and trigger their updates \code{>BrotherHandles}\\

\opamodule{OPAtune.pas/.lfm}{(15.9k)}{OPAglobal, ASfigure, ASaux.}
GUI window to show a tune diagram: resonances up to selected orders and the working point, a line or a group of tune points is shown in the diagram. This procedure is used in linear optics to show the working point or it variation with momentum, in non-lineare optics to show a predictions for the tune footprint and in tracking to show the tracked tune footprint.\\

\opamodule{OPAorbit.pas/.lfm}{(73.0k)}{OPAglobal, OpticPlot,  OpticStart, Knobframe, MathLib, ASfigure, ASaux.}
This unit calculates the beam orbit. It is used to either study orbit distortion and correction (usually in periodic mode) or to study injection (usually in forward mode)~-- a corresponding flag is set at start. Most procedureds in the unit are used to set up the rather complex GUI with knobs for correctors, kickers and BPMs and various panels for orbit correction, plotting or injection studies.

In orbit mode, correlated misalignments are applied, the response matrix is calculated and pseudo-inverted using an SVD procedure in order to correct the orbit. A loop function may run several error seeds to obtain some statistics.

In injection mode, kickers may be synchronized for correct timing, and the injected (and/or stored) beam trajectory is calculated for a few turns.

In both modes, when leaving the unit, results for misalignments and corrector settings, or for kicker settings, are saved internally and will be used in subsequent linear optics calculations or tracking.

\todo{There are problems with misalignments in tracking, not yet solved.}

Note, that correctors and BPMs defined with reserved names {\tt CH,CV,MON} in the lattice file are internally expanded to a set of individual elements, e.g. {\tt CH001...} when unpacking the lattice \code{OPAGlobal>MakeLattice}.

\subsection{Longitudinal optics}
OPA does not contain true longitudinal dynamics, i.e. all calculations are for fixed momentum offset, and tracking proceeds only in 4-D, not in 6-D. There are no cavities and no acceleration.

\opamodule{OPAmomentum.pas/.lfm}{(26.8k)}{OPAglobal, OpticPlot, ASfigure, OPAtune, MathLib, ASaux.}
\opamodule{MomentumLib.pas}{(16.5k)}{OPAglobal, OpticPlot, ASfigure, OPAtune, MathLib, ASaux.}
These two procedures calculate linear optics (periodic or forward) for some momentum range, show the results and apply a polynomial fit. The first procedure mainly controls the GUI, the second one is for calculation and plotting.
Results to fit and show are selected in the GUI. Results for path length are saved internally to be used when plotting the bucket (see next unit). Tune results are shown in a tune diagram.

\todo{A Powell minimizer was implemented once for a special purpose (non-linear bunch compressor study): it takes selected multipoles as knobs to adjust a momentum dependent function (e.g. $X(\delta)$) to a target function. However this implementation was ``quick and dirty'' and may be removed again.}\\


\opamodule{Bucket.pas/.lfm}{(19.4k)}{OPAglobal, ASfigure, MathLib, Conrect, ASaux.}
The RF bucket is calculated based on up to five orders of momentum compaction and RF harmonics as described in Appendix \ref{appbucket}, \code{>CalcBucket}, and a contour plot of equipotentials and the separatrix is shown.

The coefficients for momentum compaction may be taken over from the previous unit on momentum dependent optics. The estimates for momentum acceptance and bunch length are saved for re-use in the Touschek tracking unit (see below).\\

\subsection{Non-linear Optimization}
Non-linear optimization uses a penalty function composed from a fixed set of Hamiltonian modes on one side, which are controlled by a variable set of sextupoles and octupoles on the other side.
The dependencies are complicated, if the two minimizers are running (Powell for first and second order sextupole terms, SVD for first order octupole terms), or if chromaticity is automatically adjusted, or if target values for the (non-resonant) Hamiltonian modes are changed. This requires to pass handles from the GUI program \code{OPAChroma} to the frames for the Hamiltonian modes and the multipoles, \code{>CSexLine, CHamLIne} and between these. In order to avoid circular dependencies, two intermediate layers \code{>ChromGUILib1,2} were introduced.

\todo{The nested handles are rather messy. It works, but could be entangled and simplified.}\\

\opamodule{OPAChroma.pas/.lfm}{(40.2k)}{OPAglobal, ChromLib, ChromGUILib1, ChromGUILib2, CHamLine, CSexLine, OPAChromaSVector, OPAtune, MathLib, ASfigure, ASaux.}
Initialization of the GUI, allocating the frames for Hamiltonians and multipoles and passing all the handles between, \code{>Start} and dimensioning of the GUI \code{>ResizeAll}.
Set up (and start) the Powell minimizer for the sextupoles \code{>ButMinClick} and set up the SVD-minimizer for the octupoles \code{>ChkOctClick}.\\

\opamodule{ChromLib.pas}{(60.2k)}{OPAglobal, OpticPlot, OPAElements, OPAtune,  MathLib, Vgraph, ASaux.}
The physics part: at start, all kicks from sextupole, octupole, combined function bend (and decapole) families are collected, and matrices are set up to get the Hamiltonian modes from the $M_{\rm sx}$ sextupole and $M_{\rm oc}$ octupole families. These are a $10\times  M_{\rm sx}$ matrix for first order sextupole, a $11\times  M_{\rm sx}^2$ matrix for the second order sextupole, and a  $13\times  M_{\rm oc}$ for first order octupole. Matrix elements are sums over optical functions at all kicks (thick sextupoles contain several kicks). Quadrupoles contribute to chromatic modes and are included as a constant offset vector. These calculations are rather time consuming but only done once at start \code{>ChromInit, S\_Matrix}. Hamiltonian modes are calculated for the lattice structure considered as one period. In order to get the results for many periods, complex multiplication factors are required as described in Appendix \ref{appsexham} \code{>S\_Period}.

Chromaticity up to third order is calculated from numerical differentiation \code{>ChromDiff}. Hamiltonian modes are calculated from multipole settings using the pre-calculated matrices and weight factors entered manually in order to visualize the results and combine them into a single, scalar penalty function, see Eq.\ref{eqpenal} \code{>Driveterms}. Chromaticity is corrected with two selected sextupole families using a simple $2\times 2$ matrix \code{>UpdateChromMatrix, GetLinChroma, ChromCorrect}.

For the octupole matrix a SVD decomposition is performed for correction of the second order sextupole terms which are first order octupole terms. The SVD weight vector is provided for filtering, since usually a ``hard'' correction using all weights does not work well \code{>Oct\_SVDCMP}.
Decapoles affect only the third order chromaticities. Other third order effects are not included.\\

\opamodule{ChromGUILib1.pas}{(1.9k)}{ChromLib, CHamLine.}
This small piece of code is mainly for passing handles to the\code{>CHamLine} frames.\\

\opamodule{ChromGUILib2.pas}{(2.7k)}{ChromLib}
Pass handles to the octupole SVD functions in order to enable automatic execution during minimization, and filters the SVD weight factors.\\

\opamodule{CHamLine.pas/.lfm}{(10.7k) [Frame]}{OPAglobal, ChromLib, ChromGUILib2, CSexLine, ASaux.}
25 of these frames are embedded in the GUI at start. They display the results for the 25 Hamiltionian modes and allow weight and target values to be set. A change of target or weight triggers an update of the calculations \code{>UpdateWeight, UpdateTarget}. Changing any multipole manually or by the minimizer of course changes these frames.\\

\opamodule{CSexLine.pas/.lfm}{(11.9k) [Frame]}{OPAglobal, ChromLib, ChromGUILib1, ChromGUILib2, OPAChromaSVector, ASaux.}
At start, one of these frames is embedded in the GUI for each family of sextupole, octupole, decapole and combined function bend. It provides a knob for the magnet strength. Changing it triggers a calculation of the Hamiltonian modes. If the minimizer is running, the strength field has to follow \code{>UpdateVal...}\\

\opamodule{OPAChromaSVector.pas/.lfm}{(3.3k)}{OPAglobal, ChromLib, MathLib, ASfigure.}
Opens a small window to visualize the first order sextupole modes in the complex plane.


\subsection{Tracking}
Tracking is performed in unit {\tt TrackLib}, used by the three GUIs for phase space, dynamic aperture and Touschek tracking:

\opamodule{OPAtrackP.pas/.lfm}{(44.8k)}{OPAglobal,  OPAtune, TrackLib, MathLib, Vgraph, ASfigure, ASaux.}
Phase space tracking: the GUI contains four plot windows for the transverse phase spaces and Fourier spectra, and several panels for different options. Single particles are started from coordinates entered manually in edit fields or passed from {\tt ASfigure} mouse events \code{>ButRunClick}. For amplitude dependent tune shifts (ADTS) particle start coordinates are stepped up to aperture limits \code{>ButTushClick}. For simulation of injection, a beam ellipse populated with many particles can be tracked \code{>StartEnsemble, ButBeamRunClick, TrackBeam}. Most of the unit contains event handlers and plot routines.\\

\opamodule{OPAtrackDA.pas/.lfm}{(30.9k)}{OPAglobal,  OPAtune, TrackLib, MathLib, Vgraph, ASfigure, ASaux.}
Dynamic aperture tracking: particles are started on a grid covering the area $(x,y)$, $(x,\delta)$ or $(y,\delta)$. The grid is successively refined to get an early impression \code{>gridSetup}. Physical apertures are calculate by projecting all apertures to the trackpoint \code{>Silhouette}. The other procedures are for event handling and plotting.\\

\opamodule{OPAtrackT.pas/.lfm}{(45.7k)}{OPAglobal,  OPAtune, TrackLib, OpticPlot, MathLib, Vgraph, ASfigure,ASaux.}
Touschek tracking: Lifetime is calculated as described in Appendix \ref{apptous} from bunch volume and momentum acceptance (MA). The MA is the minimum of the linear MA given by the beam pipe apertures \code{>CalcMALin}, of the RF-MA which is derived from input parameters or has been calculated previously by {\tt Bucket}, and of the dynamic MA obtained from tracking and binary search for min./max. stable momentum offset \code{>MADyn, Trackdbins, TrackLat}.

The bunch volume is calculated from the periodic optics solution with its emittance and energy spread \code{>CalcSigma}.

The GUI has two panels for several input values affecting lifetime and for derived values \code{>Output}.

Coulomb lifetime is calculated from the effective acceptance, hower this includes only the physical, not the dynamic aperture limits \code{>CalcAccEL}. Bremsstrahlung lifetime uses the negative MA as used for Touschek lifetime too. Total lifetime is given as the inverse of the sum of the loss rates \code{>CalcLifetime}.\\

\opamodule{TrackLib.pas}{(46.2k)}{OPAglobal, OpticPlot, OPAElements, MathLib;}
At start, all linear elements are concatenated to matrices alternating with non-linear (or time dependent) kicks in order to speed up tracking \code{>TrackinMatrix}. Physical acceptances are calculated either from element apertures or from given apertures to estimate the maximum range for tracking \code{>Acceptances}. Both calculations have to be re-done when changing the reference momentum \code{>Init\_dpp}.
The available aperture in the $(x,y)$-plane is calculated for a set of rays to obtain the silhouette, i.e. projection of beam pipe apertures to the trackpoint as described in Appendix \ref{appgeoa} \code{>AmpKappa}. Optics parameters at the Trackpoint are calculated, which may be located anywhere, even inside an element \code{>TrackPoint}.

Tracking proceeds turn by turn at fixed momentum \code{>OneTurn} (or with changing momentum based on a simple model of synchtron oscillation \code{>OneTurn\_S}). Tracking one turn proceeds by repeated application of the matrix for a series of linear elements, followed by a non-linear (or time dependent) kick and a check for particle loss \code{>TMatKick}.

The procedures in the last third of the unit (from {\tt SineWindow} to the end) are for signal processing, to calculate the FFT, interpolate frequencies and guess the related resonances.\\

\subsection{Lattice Layout}
\opamodule{OPAGeometry.pas/.lfm}{(63.2k)}{OPAglobal, OpticPlot, MathLib, ASaux.}
This unit displays the lattice layout, peforms geometric matching and exports various files.
The orbit is calculated in 3D-space from element lengths, deflection and rotation angles \code{>CalcOrbit}. The orbit as curve in space is rotated and translated depending on the initial conditions \code{>setDrawMode}.
The elements are made from faces, i.e. polygons in 3D-space \code{>CalcFaces}, which become polygons when projected to 2D-space of the image plane \code{>CalcPoly}. Changing the initial conditions does not change the faces themselves but applies the same translationa and rotation to all of them \code{>TransPoly}.

\todo{Up to now the elements are ``flat'', i.e. represented by a face of some length and width in the midplane. If changing the initial angle, they look ugly. It would be straightforward to define boxes made from several faces, however this would also require some rendering algorithm for 3D-display.}

Several files can be exported, among them a \code{.geo} file of polygons \code{>butListClick}, which can also be read \code{>ReadFiles} in order to show several lattice structures in one plot.

Geometric matching looks for lattice variables with names starting with ``G'', which control lengths and deflection or rotation angles of elements (in \code{>Start}) and runs an SVD minimizer to adjust the final (or initial) coordinates and angles of the lattice structure to a target value \code{>butMatchClick}.

\todo{Geometric matching works but is not well implemented yet. More checks are required, and also an ``undo'' button should be added.}


\subsection{Temporary}
\opamodule{OPACurrents.pas/.lfm}{(10.3k)}{OPAglobal, ASaux.}
This unit calculates magnet currents using two tables for allocation (i.e. hardware type of the magnet in the lattice) and magnet calibration, which may be read with the lattice in \code{OPAGlobal> ReadAllocation, ReadCalibration}. Calculating the current from the strength parameters and v.v. is done in \code{OPAGlobal> getIfromK, getKfromI}. Due to non-linearity of the calibration curve, a bisection root finder is used \cite{numrec}.

The {\tt OPACurrents} unit provides a GUI and writes a {\tt .snap} file to be read by the storage ring control system. Among other data, this file also includes the matrices for tune change, if previously calculated by \code{OpticTune}, and for chromaticity change, calculated by \code{ChromLib> UpdateChromMatrix}.

\todo{The current calculation should be done here, not in {\tt OPAGlobal}.}\\


\opamodule{opatest.pas}{(37.3k)}{OPAglobal, OpticPlot, MathLib, ASaux.}
This unit is for temporarily needed procedures or for testing new stuff, which then, if it works well, is moved to another place.

In the present (\today) version the unit contains, among others, three procedures for reading MAD {\tt .mad}, MAD sequence {\tt .seq} and ELEGANT {\tt .lte} files. The procedures are yet incomplete but nevertheless facilitate reading these files.\\
